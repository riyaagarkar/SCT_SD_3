ðŸ“Œ Project Overview â€“ Sudoku Solver with GUI

This project is developed as part of Task 03 for the SkillCraft Technology Internship â€“ Software Development Track.

The goal of the task was to create a program that:

Automatically solves Sudoku puzzles

Accepts an input grid (with missing numbers)

Uses an efficient algorithm to compute the solution

Provides a user-friendly GUI for input and output


ðŸ§  Problem Statement:

> "Create a program that solves Sudoku puzzles automatically.
The program should take an input grid representing an unsolved Sudoku puzzle and use an algorithm to fill in the missing numbers."


ðŸ’¡ Solution Approach:

The puzzle is solved using the backtracking algorithm, a recursive method well-suited for constraint satisfaction problems like Sudoku.

The interface is developed using Python's tkinter GUI library, which allows users to:

Enter their puzzle through input boxes

Solve the puzzle with one click

Clear the board and try a new puzzle


âœ… Features:

User-driven application with GUI

Accepts custom input Sudoku puzzles

Validates and solves the puzzle using backtracking

Clear button to reset the board

Built with minimal dependencies (just Python and tkinter)
